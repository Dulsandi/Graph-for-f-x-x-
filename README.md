The project demonstrates:

- How to create and customize a 2D plot in Python.
- Saving plots as image files (PNG, JPG, or PDF).
- Adding titles, axis labels, and grid for better visualization.

The resulting plot is saved as `x_squared_graph.png` and can be used for reports, presentations, or as a reference for other Python plotting projects.
